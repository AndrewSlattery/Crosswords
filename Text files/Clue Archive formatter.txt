Format the following crossword answers and clues as TSV.
For each clue, output: ANSWER<TAB>ENUMERATION<TAB>CLUE
Use a literal tab character (\t) between columns — do not use spaces to align the text.
Match answers to clues in the order given (Across first, then Down).
Preserve exact casing, punctuation, and enumeration for ENUMERATION and CLUE.

In the ANSWER column, convert to uppercase and remove all spaces and punctuation (hyphens, apostrophes, periods, commas, etc.), normalizing diacritics to plain A–Z; ANSWER must contain only A–Z characters after normalization (e.g., “Côte d’Azur” → “COTEDAZUR”).

Output only the TSV lines, with actual tab characters between fields, and place the entire TSV inside a single code block so the tabs are preserved when copied.

Examples:

ROBROY	3,3	Cocktail of grog discovered by dude on Fourth of July
ESPRESSO	8	Joe is in Madrid marketing oil company
ABALONE	7	Austria sausage mostly fish?
FLAKE	5	Fudge coating large chocolate bar
ENCHILADA	9	Spanish dish as starter in eatery: 50% off chillies wrapped in nothing?
