# Keynesian Cryptics - Parse Notation Cheat Sheet

This document outlines the notation used to explain the solutions to the cryptic crosswords at Keynesian Cryptics.

A full parse will almost always have one of the following forms:
- `<...> X = Y`
- `X = Y <...>`
This depends on which end of the clue the definition is found.
 
## 0. Definitions

- `<...>` : Straight definition formed from part of the clue, at the beginning or end of the surface (or both, in the case of double definitions).
  - "Record cant" (271-Across-13) is parsed as `<record> LIST <cant>`; "record" and "cant" define senses of "list".

- `{...}` : Cryptic definition explanation, accompanied by the notation `<&cd>` to signify that the whole surface defines the answer, if obliquely.
  - "When two gentlemen's agreements perhaps become legally binding?" (288-Down-6) is parsed as `<&cd> SAME-SEX MARRIAGE {when e.g. two men's "I do"s bind them together legally}`

- `<&lit>` : So-called "and-lit" clue in which the entire clue acts simultaneously as a definition and as wordplay.
  - "Fourth of Persepolis, old king from the East" is parsed as `<&lit> XERXES = ←_S_ EX REX←`; Xerxes II was the fourth Achaemenid Emperor to reign from Persepolis.

## 1. Anagrams & Transpositions

- `*` : Anagram the fodder. The clue will feature an anagram indicator like "bonkers", "somehow", or "rambling".
  - "Bonkers semi-rationalist philosophy" (281-Across-1) is parsed as `(SEMI-RATIONALIST)* = ARISTOTELIANISM`.

- `↔` : Swap two letters or strings.
  - "Rogue lascar switching sides" (278-Across-16) is parsed as `LASCAR, L↔R`; the 'L' and 'R' in "LASCAR" trade positions.

- `⭯...⭯` : Cycle the component by moving a string from one end to the other.
  - "Fly with cycling propellers" (273-Down-7) is parsed as `SOAR = ⭯OARS⭯`; the 'S' cycles from the end to the start.

## 2. Deletions & Derivations

- `[-...]` : Delete indicated parts, signalled by constructions like "mostly", "topless" or "endless".
  - "Mischievous kid suddenly going out of bounds" (282-Across-25) is parsed as `URCHIN = [-l]URCHIN[-g]`; the "bounds" of LURCHING are deleted.

- `-, out of` : Delete the indicated strings, signalled by constructions like "without", "losing" or "away from", "quitting" respectively.
  - "Host's mad to snub bishop" (284-Across-9) is parsed as `ARMY = BARMY - B`; 'B' is deleted.
  - "Vinegary wines ultimately thrown out by Spartan" (276-Across-12) is parsed as `ACETIC = _S out of ASCETIC`; 'S' is deleted.

## 3. Concatenation & Positional Indicators

- `␣` (space) : Join elements in the order they appear.
  - "Blacken brown fabric" (290-Across-21) is parsed as `TAR TAN = TARTAN`.

- `+` : Join elements in the order they appear; used when the clue contains an explicit joining construction like "and", "with", or "plus".
  - "Pioneer species and each flightless bird died" (289-Across-15) is parsed as `SP + EA RHEA D = SPEARHEAD`; the + reflects "and".

- `after` : Join elements in the reverse order.
  - "Finished with location for shipping forecast" (288-Down-8) is parsed as `ENDED after PORT = PORTENDED`; ENDED "finished" appears before PORT "location for shipping" (PORT).

## 4. Containment & Insertion

- `inside/outside` : Place one component within another.
  - "Sharpen or dampen hard probes" (289-Down-1) is parsed as `WHET = WET outside H`; the answer is made of the word WET "dampen" which 'H' "hard" goes inside "probes".
  - "Prize is a bunch of cash including rand" (288-Across-17) is parsed as `AWARD = A WAD outside R`; the answer is made of the phrase A WAD "a bunch of cash" outside 'R' "rand".

## 5. Homophones

- `"..."` : Homophone the component. Clues use indicators like "heard", "in speech", or "announced".
  - "Heard salvo's sound" (282-Across-18) is parsed as `"HAIL" = HALE`.

## 6. Reversals

- `←...←` : Reverse the enclosed component.
  - "Aromatic plant is stored in laboratory upside-down" (283-Down-23) is parsed as `←IS inside LAB←`. The result of the inner operation, L(IS)AB, is reversed to get BA(SI)L.

## 7. Replacements & Translations

- `→/←` : Replace one string with another. The arrow's direction depends on the order of presentation in the clue.
  - "Chance to get Oscar instead of a western" (282-Across-22) is parsed as `ACCIDENTAL, O←A = OCCIDENTAL`; an A is replaced by O.

- `🇩🇪...🇫🇷` : Translate the enclosed component into the language indicated by the flags.
  - "Hamburger's good for digestive system" (271-Down-28) is parsed as `🇩🇪GOOD🇩🇪 = GUT <digestive system>`; the English "good" is translated to German.

## 8. Special & Complex Clue Types

- `£*...*£` (letter bank) : Anagram the fodder with repetition. Clues will typically include an anagram indicator and a word suggesting repetition.
  - "Start of soliloquy by Brontë repeatedly flubbed" (273-Across-16) is parsed as `TO BE OR NOT TO BE = £*BRONTE*£`; the answer has only the letters of BRONTE, but many appear multiple times.

- `⇐/⇒` (reverse engineering) : Reverse-engineer a phrase which can be read cryptically to indicate a word or phrase mentioned in the clue; this will be included in the parse within `{...}`.
  - "Cryptic way of saying 'peach' is jibe" (275-Across-10) is parsed as `{peach} CHEAP* ⇐ CHEAP SHOT`; the answer may be read as indicating an anagram of CHEAP, in this case "peach".

- `→"..."←` (Spoonerism) : Spoonerise the components, i.e. swap the onsets of two words in a phrase spoken aloud.
  - "Spooner's gumshoe practically formalwear" (287-Down-3) is parsed as `→"TEC NIGH"← = NECKTIE`.
